`pact` is a *semver focused*, *pessimistic* plugin manager for Neovim.

`pact` should be considered public-preview, it should function but there may be
breaking changes between versions.

Probably dont use this software. I use this software, it works (mostly) where I
want it to, but the quirks wont be for everyone and I have minimal desire to
provide support.

See DONT-README.md and SPEC.md if you really want to.
