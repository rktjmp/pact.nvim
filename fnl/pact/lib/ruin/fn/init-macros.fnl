When called, `fn*' functions compare the arguments recieved against the
patterns defined and executes the first matching function body.

`fn*' functions are useful if you want a very strict API (by default they
will raise an error if no pattern matched the arguments recieved), or to
simplify dispatching against different argument types. The `enum` module
uses this macro heavily as an example.

Generally you probably should prefer regular `fn` functions with `match` unless
you know you want very strict argument checks or particular behaviour depending
on the arguments received.

Patterns are checked in the order they are defined and have strict arity
checks (unless `...` is in the argument list, then the arity is
defined as *at least n* where *n* is the number of other arguments).

Matched functions may be anonymous, which requires all match heads and bodies
to be defined at once, or they may be named. Named functions may have zero
match heads and body pairs, able to be defined later by `fn+'.

`?name` may be a symbol or multisym to attach to existing tables.

After `name`, sequential pairs of `(where [arg arg ...] (?clauses ...))
(expression)` can be provided. The `where` clauses define the function pattern
match and the expression is the function body.

Matches are checked in the order given, so higher specificity patterns should
be first.

Arguments matching follow `(match)` semantics *except `& rest` is unsupported
and `...` is* - this aligns closer to regular function arguments.
Arguments may be symbols or values. Destructuring is supported. Arguments may
not be nil unless defined as nil-able by prefixing with `?` or with the
explicit value (eg: `[a b nil]`).

As with `(match)`, values in patterns may match previously defined in-scope
symbols. This is explicity opt-in for `fn*', and symbols should be prefixed with
`^` to *\"pin\"* the value and indicate it should match the outer scope.

A default \"match all\" handler can be defined with `(where _)`, the handler
will receive `...` as an argument.

See also `fn+' to add additional patterns to an existing function.

Each call to `fn*` creates 4 local variables (3 if the function is assigned to
a field of an existing table). The function bodies specified with `fn*` do
not allocate additional variables. Lua has a limit of 200 local variables, you
can create new scopes with `(do)`.
