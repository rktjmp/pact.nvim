;;; Package
;;;
;;; Where a `Pact.Plugin.Spec` represents some vague details about where a
;;; plugin might come from and how it prefers to handle updates, a package
;;; represents much more concrete facts such as a location on disk, the current
;;; checkout sha, any pending actions, running logs, etc.
;;;
;;; Users operate with the spec to define a desired state but the package is
;;; the truth.
;;;
;;; Ideally packages are actually somewhat agnostic to source and type. Most
;;; commonly they will be just git-repo+nvim-plugin but it should also handle
;;; luarocks, cargo, etc if desired.
